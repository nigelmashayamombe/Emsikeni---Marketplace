🛒 Marketplace App – Project Summary
📍 Project Title:
ZimTradeConnect – A Hybrid Marketplace for Zimbabwe’s Informal & Formal Traders
________________________________________
❗️Problem Statement
Zimbabwe's informal economy is the backbone of local trade, employing over 80% of the population, yet buying and selling remain fragmented, unregulated, and difficult to scale due to:
•	Lack of online visibility for informal sellers
•	High fraud risk and trust issues in buyer-seller transactions
•	Unstructured delivery options with no real tracking
•	Inconsistent pricing due to currency volatility (USD, ZiG, Rand)
•	Exclusion of feature phone users from digital trade
•	No centralized platform supporting group buying, fresh markets, or rural transactions
________________________________________
💡 Proposed Solution
We are building a lightweight, mobile-first marketplace app designed specifically for Zimbabwean users — from urban buyers to rural agro-traders — to buy, sell, negotiate, and deliver safely and conveniently.
The app combines:
•	Mobile e-commerce (PWA + USSD),
•	Informal logistics (bike/foot delivery),
•	Trust-building features (ratings, seller verification),
•	Offline-friendly messaging & cash options,
into one hybrid platform that reflects the realities of Zimbabwean commerce.
